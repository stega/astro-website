    <p class="mt-5 mb-10">
      A mix of electronic and acoustic drums with a healthy dose of Korgs
      MonoPoly VST. The name refers to when we said goodbye to Chulah, a dog we
      rescued on the streets in Spain. She was with us for 3 months before we
      found a home for her. I'm not sure the mood of the song ever captured our
      sadness though - maybe it's more indicative of the guilt we felt as she
      stared out of the car window at us as she was being driven away!
