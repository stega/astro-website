    <small>Ableton Live, Fender Telecaster</small>
    <p class="mt-5 mb-10">
      For this track, I decided to play with Abletons time and pitch stretching
      as an alternative to drum fills/breaks. The song turned out more rhythmic
      than melodic, with my guitar and synths used for texture and the bass
      adding a little bounce.
